# A Configurable Sandbox

Developing new services for a hybrid cloud is difficult and slow because of complex interdependencies between network and security settings and the service's configuration and because it's tough to replicate essential supporting services (like databases) outside the dynamic, container-based part of the cloud. This project offers a configurable sandbox to speed up development by solving the replication problem. It creates a full, reproducible copy of a service's setup, including the service itself and its supporting services. The sandbox is isolated at the operating system level, this means the replicated environment is kept completely separate and won't interfere with your host computer. It is primarily built on NixOS and uses the Nix package manager to guarantee that the environment is reproducible. It can also run on [Windows (via WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about), [ChromeOS (via CROSH)](https://chromeos.dev/en/linux), and [macOS](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin) with minor adjustments.

## Key Design Criteria

The sandbox is built with the following criteria to ensure that the services developed within it are reproducible and reliable:

* *No Vendor Lock-in:* It must be independent of specific production tools or hosting services (like Kubernetes or a particular cloud provider). This ensures the operating model can be freely chosen for deployment.
* *Flexible and Portable:* It needs a flexible system configuration to allow the service to be deployed and run on any diverse hardware platform.
* *Secure Distribution:* It must use a package cache for distribution. This provides supply chain control and enables secure, non-interactive, unattended updates.
* *Reliable Rollbacks:* The system configurations must be declarative (describing what the system should look like, not how to build it). This allows for fast and easy rollbacks if any malfunction occurs.

The sandbox is designed to be a portable, secure, and easily reversible environment that doesn't dictate your final production setup.

## Technology Stack

Other than a developer sandbox, the engineering sandbox does not rely on certain design paradigms, like micro-service or three tier architectures, but utilizes a functional system-configuration language to enable hybrid service configurations and accelerate a transition from development to testing and production for services that span private- and public clouds. A programmable paket manager eliminates the need for system configuration tools like Ansible, Script Runner and/or Rundeck and helps to avoid the use of hypervisors or container clusters if virtualization is not beneficial.

Operators remain flexible to choose the optimal delivery method for a service component after developers have finished their work - based on application requirements only. Unlike traditional automation tools that merge application requirements, system definitions, and implementation instructions in complex configuration files, system modules keep application requirements separate from system- and cloud-provider dependencies and enable operators to enforce security policies and to validate regulatory compliance without launching a service.

![Technology Stack](./doc/img/diagrams-technology.svg)

A layered architecture allows system engineers to separate the base system configuration from service blueprints that deploy host-dependent services, such as databases, with node artifacts deployable as distributed systems in clusters or serverless environments and from developer tools, like IDE, git and diagram tools. Architectural layers maintain the flexibility for engineers while standardizing operational processes. The first layer is represented by a system flake that captures hardware- and system dependencies for the developer host. The configuration remains decoupled from the application set to prevent platform dependencies. The flake relies on nix modules to address context-specific machine requirements, such as mobility functions, cloud provider settings, or company-specific monitoring agents. The second layer defined using an environment flake, modules deploy solution components link hosted backend services to ensure a homgenous development environment accross teams. The third layer is defined with a user flake referring to modules that provide the developer toolset and captures configurations for developer services.

The sandbox can be deployed on every host system, the default scenario is a local machine, which empowers engineers to override default settings at any layer, without triggering security concerns. Isolated machines enable security operators and service architects to test the entire stack with a functional model before staging and production. Local instances also eliminate implicit dependencies on higher level packaging formats and provider specific orchestrators, fostering a decentralized development process with configuration templates shared via Git. Programmatic assembly of dedicated servers ensures reproducibility, isolation, and atomic upgrades with consistent package deployments, independent of specific vendors or solutions. Dependencies and build instructions are specified in configuration files, facilitating clear separation of duties through simple directory or file access management.

### The System Flake (Admin/Root)

The system flake is stored in the traditional root-owned location and is used to controls the core operating system.

| Directory | Location | Purpose |
| :------- | :------ | :------- |
| System Flake Root  |  /etc/nixos  |   Host OS control, manages the kernel, NixOS services, user accounts, and Nix settings.  |
| flake.nix  |  /etc/nixos/flake.nix |  Defines the host machine's configuration output (e.g., nixosConfigurations."myserver").  |
| configuration.nix |  /etc/nixos/configuration.nix |  Imports base modules, sets up users (e.g., users.users.alice), enables direnv and core services.  |

### The Environment Flakes (Isolated/Project-Specific)
These are the development environments, tied directly to project code via direnv.

| Directory | Location | Purpose |
| :------- | :------ | :------- |
| Environment Flake Root | ~/projects/myproject | Project isolation, manages tools specific to a single project. |
| flake.nix | ~/projects/myproject/flake.nix | Defines the devShells.x86_64-linux.default output and pins the specific, potentially older/unstable nixpkgs version needed for the project. |
| shell.nix | ~/projects/myproject/shell.nix | Imported by flake.nix, defines the contents of the shell environment. |
| .envrc | ~/projects/myproject/.envrc | Contains the single line: use flake to enable direnv integration. |
| flake.lock | ~/projects/myproject/flake.lock | Locks the version of nixpkgs used for project dependencies. This is the key to isolation. |

### The User Flake (Shared/Consistent)

This is the source of truth for all user-level applications and dotfiles. It is shared across all environments and machines.

| Directory | Location | Purpose |
| :------- | :------ | :------- |
| Directory  |  Location  |  Purpose  |
| User Flake Root  |  ~/.config/  |  User consistency. Manages all shared Home Manager configuration.  |
| flake.nix  |  ~/.config/flake.nix  |  Defines homeManagerModules.common (your shared config) and pins its own nixpkgs version.  |
| modules/common/default.nix  |  ~/.config/modules/common/default.nix  |  The shared core file. Defines all common packages (tmux, neovim, git config) and modules (your default.nix content).  |
| modules/profiles/desktop.nix  |  ~/.config/modules/profiles/desktop.nix  |  Optional: Contains modules for desktop-only apps (like window manager config).  |
| flake.lock  |  ~/.config/flake.lock  |  Locks the version of Home Manager and nixpkgs used for user configuration.  |

Environment Flakes import this user flakes as an input (e.g., inputs.my-home.url = "path:~/dotfiles").

### Workflow Summary
To boot the machine: Run sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake /etc/nixos#myserver.
To change your shared user tools: Edit ~/dotfiles/modules/common/default.nix and run home-manager switch --flake ~/dotfiles#<username>.
To work on a project: cd ~/projects/project-X. direnv automatically loads the project's specific shell, which imports the consistent user packages defined in your ~/dotfiles flake.

## Using Direnv

### Prerequisites
Before setting this up, ensure you have:

Nix Flakes Enabled: (You already do this).
direnv installed: It should be installed on your system and hooked into your shell (e.g., added to your .bashrc, .zshrc, or equivalent).
The Nix direnv Integration: The Home Manager or NixOS modules for direnv often install this, but if you're using a manual installation, you must ensure the use_nix or use_flake functionality is available.

### The use_flake Method (Recommended)
The best and most modern way to integrate Nix flakes with direnv is by using the use_flake helper function.

#### Define the Environment in flake.nix
In your developer environment flake (e.g., in ~/dev-env-A/flake.nix), ensure you define a devShells output. This is the part that direnv will load.

```sh
# ~/dev-env-A/flake.nix
{
  # ... inputs defined here ...
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, ... }:
  let
    system = "x86_64-linux";
    pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit system; };
  in
  {
    # ðŸ’¡ Dev Shells output is what direnv looks for
    devShells.${system}.default = pkgs.mkShell {
      packages = with pkgs; [
        # Environment-specific tools
        docker # System engineer tool
        kubectl
        go
      ];

      # Environment variables for the shell
      shellHook = ''
        echo "Nix Dev Environment A (Legacy) loaded."
        export PROJECT_ROOT="$(pwd)"
      '';
    };
  };
}
```

#### Create the .envrc File
In the root of that same directory (~/dev-env-A), create a .envrc file with a single line:

```sh
# ~/dev-env-A/.envrc
use flake
```

#### Allow the Environment
The first time you do this, direnv will ask for permission (a security measure to prevent arbitrary code execution):

```sh
cd ~/dev-env-A
# direnv: error .envrc is blocked. Run `direnv allow` to approve its contents
direnv allow
```

Now, every time you cd into ~/dev-env-A:

direnv reads .envrc.
use flake tells direnv to find the nearest flake.nix file.
direnv calls nix develop --command bash (or equivalent) for the default devShells output.
The specified packages (docker, kubectl, go) and the shellHook are loaded into your current shell session.
### Alternative: Specifying the Flake Output

If your flake has multiple shell outputs, you can specify exactly which one to use in your .envrc:

```sh
# ~/dev-env-A/.envrc
# Use a specific shell output named 'backend'
use flake .#backend
```

## Subscribe to a common developer toolset
A shared Home Manager module *default.nix* in the home directory maintains a consistent developer application set across environments. This ensures that all developer environments share the same user-level applications, dotfiles, and shell settings via the shared Home Manager code. Eventhough each developer environment flake can use a different nixpkgs version (e.g., for specific system libraries).

### Create a Dedicated Home Manager Flake (The Source of Truth)
Create a separate repository or directory (e.g., ~/dotfiles) that houses your user configuration logic.

```sh
# ~/dotfiles/flake.nix This flake's primary job is to expose the shared configuration logic as a reusable module.
{
  description = "Shared Home Manager configuration";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    home-manager.url = "github:nix-community/home-manager";
    home-manager.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
  };

  outputs = { self, home-manager, ... }: {
    # ðŸ’¡ The key is defining a reusable module output
    homeManagerModules.common = import ./default.nix;

    # Optionally, expose the standalone configuration for non-NixOS
    homeConfigurations."alice" = home-manager.lib.homeManagerConfiguration {
      # ...
    };
  };
}
~/dotfiles/default.nix (Your shared application set) This file defines all your core user applications and dotfiles.

{ config, pkgs, lib, ... }:

{
  # Define all the user packages you want in ALL environments
  home.packages = with pkgs; [
    git
    tmux
    neovim
    jq
    htop
  ];

  # Define common dotfile configurations
  programs.zsh.enable = true;
  programs.git.enable = true;
  programs.git.userName  = "Alice Engineer";

  # Allow customization based on the environment importing this file
  # Example: Only enable a graphical tool if the environment is a desktop one
  # programs.alacritty.enable = lib.mkIf config.custom.isDesktop;

  home.stateVersion = "24.05";
}
2. Import the Home Flake into Your Environment Flakes
Now, in each of your developer environment flakes (e.g., ~/dev-env-A and ~/dev-env-B), you import the shared Home Flake and use its module output.

~/dev-env-A/flake.nix (The NixOS configuration for a development system)

{
  description = "NixOS Config for Dev Environment A (Legacy)";

  inputs = {
    # Pin a specific, stable nixpkgs version for isolation
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-23.11";

    # Import your shared home configuration
    my-home.url = "path:~/dotfiles"; # Use path: for local file system
    # my-home.url = "github:alice/dotfiles"; # Use github: for remote repo

    home-manager.url = "github:nix-community/home-manager";
    home-manager.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs"; # HM follows THIS flake's pkgs
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, my-home, home-manager, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations."dev-machine" = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      modules = [
        # ... Other NixOS modules

        # ðŸ’¡ Import Home Manager as a module
        home-manager.nixosModules.home-manager {
          home-manager.useUserPackages = true;
          home-manager.users.alice = {
            imports = [
              # ðŸ’¡ Import the shared module from the 'my-home' input!
              my-home.homeManagerModules.common

              # Add environment-specific overrides/packages here:
              { home.packages = with pkgs; [ specific-tool-v1.0 ]; }
            ];
          };
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

By making the *~/dotfiles* flake an input to all environment flakes, we ensure that all environments receive the consistent set of applications and configuration defined in *default.nix*, while still allowing each environment to manage its own core dependencies and specific NixOS settings.

## Flakes for Developer Environments
For system engineering environments, the isolation, portability, and independence offered by separate flakes are worth the management overhead.


* *Dedicated Flakes for Nix Shells* Define each environment as a separate flake (or a subdirectory containing a flake) that primarily exposes the devShells output. Engineers use the nix develop command, which is non-invasive to the host system.

```sh
nix develop path/to/env-A/
```

* *Dedicated Flakes for Virtual Machines/Containers* Define each environment as a separate flake that exposes nixosConfigurations intended to be built as a VM or container. This is the ultimate isolation for system engineers.

```sh
nix build path/to/env-A/#nixosVM
```

### Advantages of Separate Flakes for Dev Environments
For system engineering environments, the isolation benefits of separate flakes usually outweigh the overhead.

1. True Dependency Pinning and Isolation (Crucial)
System engineering often involves maintaining old systems or testing against specific historical library versions (e.g., a specific compiler, a known-bug version of a database). A separate flake allows you to pin the exact nixpkgs version needed for that environment without affecting any other environment or the base operating system.

2. Self-Contained and Portable
Each environment becomes a standalone unit that can be checked out, built, and used anywhere Nix is installed (NixOS, macOS, WSL, etc.).
This is ideal for sharing: "Here's the flake for the legacy project; it defines everything."

3. Independent System Overrides (Configuration)
If one environment needs to test an overlay that modifies a core system package (e.g., overriding the global Python or adding an unstable patch to gcc), it can do so within its own flake's inputs without risking the host system or other environments.

4. Better for nix develop (Nix Shells)
Separate flakes are the standard way to define reproducible developer shells (nix develop). Engineers can simply run nix develop within the flake directory to instantly load the required tools, environment variables, and pre-commit hooks, without needing a full nixos-rebuild switch.

### Disadvantages of Separate Flakes
1. Management Overhead
You will be managing many small Git repositories and a multitude of flake.lock files, increasing the overhead for updating common security patches (like OpenSSL).

2. Increased Duplication
If 80% of your environments use the same core utilities (e.g., git, neovim, bash), you'll be duplicating the package definitions across many flakes, or you'll need to create a shared "utility flake" input.

3.No Centralized Host System Control
Your /etc/nixos will now only manage the base operating system. You lose the ability to easily audit all packages and services running on the machine from a single configuration file.


## System Configuration

The default deployment method is a minimal Linux operating system, providing only essential hardware communication components. A dynamic package loader, governed by application platform requirements, then adds necessary packages using templates, eliminating the need for external orchestrators, custom packaging, or specific communication patterns. This approach allows operations teams to centrally manage service designs through deployment artifacts, while the deployment itself is delegated to operation. A git repository is employed to track and revert system configurations and immutable artifacts, without impacting coresponding services, network, or storage interfaces. Virtual environments require enough space to cache the platform components, a minimum size of *80 to 120GB* is recommended. Nevertheless, this really depends on the number and the complexity of the service blueprints that are being developed.

```sh
â”œâ”€â”€ configuration.nix
â””â”€â”€ modules
    â”œâ”€â”€ sandbox.nix (configuration)
 Â Â  â””â”€â”€ system (modules)
 Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ powersave.nix
 Â Â      â””â”€â”€ zsh.nix
```

The sandbox provides the configuration files for a nix package manager, such as [Nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nix), [Lix](https://lix.systems/) or [Tvix](https://tvix.dev/). The `configuration.nix` is only required for NixOS and contains minimum information and references configuration modules, captured in under `./modules/system`. Packages load additional software, the functional [programming language](https://nix.dev/tutorials/nix-language.html) defines and automates provisioning processes via executable templates. Available packages are listed at the [package directory](https://search.nixos.org/packages) and the command `nix-env -qaP` provides a list incl. available attributes for sripting. Engineers define [system configurations](https://nix.dev/tutorials/packaging-existing-software.html) using declarative files, ensuring isolated dependencies and creating clean, reproducible systems without the overhead of virtual machines or containers. `Override` functions enable engineers to build packages from source by processing additional attributes.

## Resource Composition

[Direnv](https://direnv.net/) extends a system with service specific configurations and dynamically loads or unloads system configurations based on directory changes. Nix's virtual filesystem ensures dependency isolation between software packages, enhancing stability. Direnv uses the .envrc file to reference configurations that automatically trigger provisioning. Upon entering a directory for the first time, a flag must be set to allow Direnv to monitor configuration changes and load the defined tools. Subsequently, Direnv checks for the .envrc file and, if present, makes the defined variables available in the current shell. While Nix offers various methods for separating environment definitions, Direnv only requires a reference to the configuration file within .envrc.

```sh
â”œâ”€â”€ flake.nix
â””â”€â”€ modules
 Â Â  â””â”€â”€ services (modules)
 Â Â   Â Â  â””â”€â”€ github.nix
```

## Development Tools

[Home-Manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/) allows to define project specific user profiles and enables the system-wide installations of customized software environments even when these affect the system configuration. Administrators maintain company standards by managing the home directory including environment settings on a developer maschine with declarative configuration files in a git repository. Relying on modules provides a structured way to organize and maintain dotfiles for various applications and enables the installation of solution-specific software packages. It supports two ways of deploying applications, programs and packages. Home managers [option search](https://home-manager-options.extranix.com/) lists available programs with settings. Program modules abstract this difference from the deployment process, each module installs the software and configures system wide features. Service modules represent hosted services. These modules contain configuration options and the secrets to access an external system from the developer maschine.

```sh
â”œâ”€â”€ flake.nix
â”œâ”€â”€ home.nix
â”œâ”€â”€ profiles
|Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ default.nix (development)
|Â Â  â””â”€â”€ consult.nix
â””â”€â”€ modules
 Â Â  â””â”€â”€ programs (modules)
 Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ gnome.nix
 Â Â   Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ chrome.nix
 Â Â   Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ claude.nix
 Â Â   Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ gephi.nix
 Â Â   Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ghostty.nix
 Â Â   Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ obsidian.nix
 Â Â   Â Â  â””â”€â”€ zed.nix
```

Home manager profiles encapsulate a set of settings, preferences, data, and permissions, that are specific to a context. Profile switching allows developers to quickly load and use a different set of these configurations. Managed profiles provide security and privacy, as each user's files and settings are isolated. It also prevents accidental changes to system settings by non-admin users.

```sh
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake '.#nixbook-default'
```

## Service Configuration

Finally, development environments are defined by creating a directory, setting up a git repository, and sharing the repository with other developers via Github. Service development environments combine resource composition with a runtime and are defined with [devenv.sh](https://devenv.sh/), a configuration tool that dynamically combines local processes, representing the backing services with runtimes and containers for services developers. Devenv leverages Nix to create reproducible development environments, it is an extension of the Nix ecosystem, tailored for development workflows. Processes are scheduled with [process-compose](https://github.com/F1bonacc1/process-compose). The entire environment is launched, calling the process manager with a single command.

```sh
â””â”€â”€ user
 Â Â  â””â”€â”€ projects
 Â Â   Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ .devenv
 Â Â   Â Â  â””â”€â”€ devenv.nix
```

A developer might have different workspace layouts, tool presets, and shortcut configurations saved as profiles for different tasks during a project. service configuration improve focus and productivity by allowing developers to quickly load the most efficient setup for the task at hand. a specific service compostions is loaded with the devenv command.

```sh
devenv up

```

## Usage

* Navigating between windows: `super` + 0 ... 9 for the app in the dock

### Ghostty Navigation
To create a new split window in Ghostty, you can use the keybindings `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`O` (or Cmd+D on macOS) to create a horizontal split, and `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`E` (or Cmd+Shift+D on macOS) to create a vertical split. To navigate between splits, use `Ctrl`+`Super`+`[` (or Cmd+[ on macOS) to focus the previous split, and `Ctrl`+`Super`+`]` (or Cmd+] on macOS) to focus the next split.
