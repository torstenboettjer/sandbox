The inventx Sandbox is an opinionated take on a Linux as a developer environment
for service engineers. It includes a curated set of tools, so someone coming
from a platform like Windows or Mac can immediately start writing code, without
too much configuration work. The sandbox is build on NixOS and includes a number
of tools in form of modules. Package management is only half the battle of
getting a great development experience going on Linux, though. The other half
lies in the dotfiles that control the configuration. Linux gets great power from
how customizable it is, but that also presents a paradox of choice and a tall
learning curve. Having good, curated defaults that integrate all the many tools
in a coherent feel and look can help more developers acquire a taste for Linux,
which they may then later inspire a fully bespoke setup (or not!). Nothing in
Omakub provides solutions to problems you couldn’t also solve a million other
ways. The main benefit is in *The Omakase Spirit*. The idea that an entire setup
experience can benefit from being tailored upfront by someone with strong
opinions about what works and looks good together. This doesn’t make the choices
necessarily better than other choices. Linux has inspired a million options for
a million tastes. That’s great and worthy of celebration. But there’s a large
constituency of developers who are more than willing to trade ultimate bespoke
customization for a cohesive package of goods, at least until they understand
what all the options are and have fully bought into making the switch to Linux.
Omakub is for all these future Linux users. --- ## What’s on the menu Omakub
contains a mix of open source and commercial software. This isn’t meant as a
Free Software Only compilation, but as a mixtape for working web developers who
might begrudge Google, but still want to use the same Chrome browser that the
majority of regular web users do. So you’ll find that browser as the default
(Firefox is still there too), Spotify is installed by default, as is Zoom, and
even 1Password. Don’t worry, you can just remove (or ignore) anything you don’t
need or want. But the heart of the pre-configuration lies in the terminal,
[Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/), which runs [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/) to
provide multiple panes/sessions. It’s still bash underneath, but one configured
with a host of great file system tools, like `eza`, `fzf`, `rg`, `zoxide`, and
`bg`. Don’t worry if you don’t know what any of those things are! Watch the
introduction video, and you’ll see it all in action. Then comes the editor. As
much as I love [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) now, it’s not for everyone, so by
default Omakub comes with both Neovim (configured via
[lazyvim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)) and Microsoft’s VSCode. There are plenty of
other choices, but these two are the ones that have been integrated into the
unified theme picking. The overall UI of Ubuntu is of course Gnome, but it’s
been tweaked substantially to cater to a keyboard-first and window-tiling
workflow. You shouldn’t be moving windows around with a mouse. Use the six
default workspaces for apps (hotkeys: `Super+1/2/3…`), preferably full-screen
ones on laptop displays (`F11`), or tiled neatly using Tactile (`Super+T`).
Speed of motion is also why all the transition animations have been nerfed. And
start any app in the dock (`Super`) based on its position (`Alt+1/2/3/4`). So
browser is just `Alt+1`, Terminal `Alt+2`, etc. Additionally,
[Ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io/) provides an app launcher ala Raycast, which
you trigger with `Super+Space`. And you can quickly enter emojis with the
compose key (mapped to Caps Lock) and then a single letter representing the
emoji. Run `omakub`, pick hotkeys, and you can see it all. --- ## What’s the
dress code By default, Omakub ships with a *Tokyo Night* theme. After
installation, run the `omakub` command, select “Theme”, and pick from one of the
curated themes. Picking a new theme sets colors for the terminal (Alacritty +
Zellij) and the editor (VSCode and Neovim), as well as a matching background
image and Gnome UI accent color. The font is Microsoft’s *Cascadia Mono*,
patched by [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/). Run `omakub`, select
“Font”, and pick one of the options. It’ll be set in terminal and editor
automatically. A handful of Gnome Extensions provide some extra polish with
blurring of the shell, hiding desktop icons, and other tweaks. Run the Gnome
Extensions Manager (`Super+Space` → “extensions”). --- ## What else Omakub also
installs: * WhatsApp + Signal for messaging. *
[Xournal++](https://xournalpp.github.io/) for filling out and signing PDF forms.
* [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/) for screenshots (`Ctrl+Print Screen`). *
VLC for videos. * LibreOffice for Office docs. *
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for note-taking. *
[Pinta](https://www.pinta-project.com/) for quick image editing. * `gh` GitHub
CLI. * Docker, with preconfigured MySQL + Redis containers and
[lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker). *
[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to manage Ruby, Node.js, Python, Go, Java, etc. *
A fix for the [Framework](https://frame.work/) 13’s first-gen display font
proportions. --- ## Installing Omakub You need: 1. An x86 computer (e.g.,
[Framework 13](https://frame.work/), [Beelink
SER8](https://www.bee-link.com/products/beelink-ser8-8845hs), [Minisforum UM870
Slim](https://www.minisforum.com/products/minisforum-um870-slim)). 2. A USB
drive (32GB+) for the Ubuntu installer. 3. Ubuntu 24.04 (or later). See
[instructions](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview).
Then: 1. Install Ubuntu, set screen resolution to 200%. 2. Open a terminal
(`Ctrl+Alt+T`) and run: ```bash wget -qO- https://omakub.org/install | bash ```
Follow prompts, approve Gnome Extension confirmations, log out, log back in. ---
## Origin and context Omakub was started by [David Heinemeier
Hansson](https://dhh.dk) to streamline Linux box bootstrapping at 37signals and
help developers switch from macOS. Read more in [Linux as the New Developer
